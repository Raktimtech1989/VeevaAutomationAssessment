   DatapreoviderUtils
   ExcelUtils
   PropertyUtils
   SnapshotUtils
   
6) Created framework in such a way like it gives all the control to the developer to do changes dynamically without touching code base 
   Thus reusability & maintanance effort will be reduced.   
   
   
7) Listeners implemented with customised and dynamic reporting integrated .

8) Framework is open for extension and close for modification, thus followed the SOLID Design p[rinceiples while implementing .

9) Parallel & cross browser testing have bee implemented with open for CI CD integration .

10) No hard coding done, No static wait implemented , no direct use of custom selenium APIs, everything have been wrapped behind the scenes . 
    
11) Can be easily integrated with docker containers and ELK stack as well .
