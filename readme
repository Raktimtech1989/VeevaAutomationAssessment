   ExcelUtils
   PropertyUtils
   SnapshotUtils
   
6) Created framework in such a way like it gives all the control to the developer to do changes dynamically without touching code base 
   Thus reusability & maintanance effort will be reduced.   
   
   
7) Listeners implemented with customised and dynamic reporting integrated .

8) Framework is open for extension and close for modification, thus followed the SOLID Design p[rinceiples while implementing .
